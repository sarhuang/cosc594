The goal is to build an interactive game with the LED 8x8 matrix. Not only does the game need to be fun, but it should also use an inventive input device. For our game, we decided to recreate Stacker, an arcade game that challenges the player to build a tower with blocks row by row without missing. Instead of a button, the inventive inputs will be a slider that places the block and a photoresistor that dictates the speed of the block.

In this assignment, the goal is to rethink the materiality of computing and interaction. You must make a primary input device (e.g., paper joystick) or a primary output device (e.g., ambient display) using low-tech materials such as paper, conductive paint, play-dough, tape, water, food, etc. The primary interactivity must be mediated by the low- tech material (i.e., the low-tech material cannot be superfluous to your design, it must be directly integrated).

Use the IMU (along with other sensors if desired) to create a physical-based interaction that is digitized, analyzed, and then used to control/actuate (provide haptics or move things) in the real world.
